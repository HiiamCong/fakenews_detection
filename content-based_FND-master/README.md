This is my Honours Project for my BSc Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen

# System Requirements

64-bit Linux/Ubuntu machine
15GB RAM

Dependencies

* Python 2.7 or higher 2.x version
* Python 3.5 or higher 3.x version
* OpenKE 1 - no need to download this as it comes as a part of the project files
* KnowledgeStream 2 - no need to download this either as it comes as a part of the project files
too. However, you will need to download the original KnowledgeStream test data 3 if you
intend to use it.
* Stanford CoreNLP
* MongoDB
* Python packages
	* pip and pip3 or easy_install - for installing new packages
	* pandas
	* numpy
	* sklearn
	* requests
	*  bs4
	* pymongo
	* nltk
	* pycorenlp
	* neuralcoref

# Running the System

1. Start your mongoDB instance with parameters `mongod –nojournal –dbpath /path/to/mongo`
replacing /path/to/mongo with the path where you have installed mongod

2. Navigate to the folder where you have installed CoreNLP. Start the CoreNLP server with
the command
```
java -mx8g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -annotators "tok-
enize,ssplit,pos,lemma,parse,sentiment" -port 9000 -timeout 30000
```

You can replace the number in -mx8g by a lower or higher one depending on the power
of the RAM available on your maching. Keep in mind that anything below 4 will require
a long time to start the server.

3. Navigate to the main project folder and start the system with `python3 main.py`
